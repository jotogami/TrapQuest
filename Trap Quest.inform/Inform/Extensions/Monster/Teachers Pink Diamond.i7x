Matching baby booties adorn [his of M] feet. A red collar around [his of M] neck, a red pacifier in [his of M] mouth, and a pair of cuffs keeping [his of M] arms bound behind [his of M] back completely remove any sense of threat or power.

Matching furry cuffs keep [his of M] ankles close together, locked into baby pink platform boots - definitely not [his of M] style. The red marks on [his of M] bare backside are evidence of frequent and recent spankings. A spider gag keeps [his of M] mouth permanently open. [big his of M] breasts, pussy and ass are all completely exposed.

[big he of M] also has matching red elbow-length gloves, with more matching fur at the wrists. [big his of M] short red chunky heels, perfect posture, elegant gait and welcoming smile give [him of M] an aura of dignity, grace and power.
